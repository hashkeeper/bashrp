# bashrp
## Gamifying linux

BashRPG or .bashrp is an attempt to gamify the linux experience. Playing this game with require users to use engage with it through the linux filesystem. In other words, playing this game will make you a more compentent system administrator.

# Schema 
multiple components will make up this game:
### /usr/bin/brpg -- the main toolchain
### ~/.bashrp
similar to .bashrc, runs upon login and mods user experience. user specific role playing information can be placed here. I want the game to have a way to interpret and place ASCII art, so the user can open the .bashrp file and see there is a place for a user icon made of ASCII art when they run the ./bashrp toolchain to enter the game.
### /etc/bashrp -- 
a directory including a config file that modifies the base game. I want the game to directly route into programming education software and youre progress with them so files here will be used in linking your bashrpg to your freecodecamp, codewars, hackthebox ect ect. A huge part of bashrpg is your progressing in learning in general so here is how you link in your completely justifiable bragging rights

# Short-term goals
creating a makefile that creates what is mentioned in #Scheme. 

# Long-term goals 
Create a team of people who understand the intentions of this project and who can commit to it. There isn't too much in the way of creativity to the project because there is a geniune use-case for the project that is described. The creativity comes later once this vanilla framework is created. 
Create custom ISOs, in various rpg class flavors, that launch a little virtual machine where that class is set up and ready to go. this would enforce the philosophy of the project that the game is a linux system itself. 
The game allows for p2p communication through ssh or... ipfs, the game is a service that is also a server, and allows for communication between profiles. 
The game becomes a game about hacking eachother

Okay these ideas go off but I really do believe this project has a beautiful design philosophy and with help could happen.
thanks for your interest.
